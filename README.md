# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for 
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide 
of the Socket.IO website.

Changes done:
============
i) Added nickname support.
ii) Donâ€™t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.


Please refer to it to learn how to run this application.
